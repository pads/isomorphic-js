# About

Demonstrating Isomorphic JavaScript for [BrumJS](http://brumjs.github.io/)

The example application uses:

- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) as templates to render on both client and server.
- [React Router Component](http://strml.viewdocs.io/react-router-component) for both client and server side routing.
- [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to package the server JS code to also be used on the client.
- [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) to communicate with the API from both client and server.

# Todo

- Make a useful app using CRUD operations.
- Refactor.

# Setup

[mongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/install-on-linux/) instance installed first, then:
